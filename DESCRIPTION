Description: Everyone needs to be taken down a peg once in a while, especially
    oneself! Forked from the complementary (and complimentary!) package praise,
    malign provides ready-made insults for use when code does run not as expected.
    Useful for troubleshooting code, or just to make oneself feel worse.
