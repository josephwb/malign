## Overview
Everyone needs to be taken down a peg once in a while, especially oneself! Forked
from the complementary (_and_ complimentary!) package [praise](https://github.com/rladies/praise), malign provides
ready-made insults for use when code does not run as expected. Useful for
troubleshooting code, or just to make oneself feel bad.

## Installation


```r
devtools::install_github("josephwb/malign");
```

## Usage


```r
library(malign);
malign();
```

```
#> [1] "You are upsetting!"
```

You can supply a template, and `malign()` fills in random words of the specified
part of speech:


```r
malign("${EXCLAMATION}! You have done this ${adverb_manner}!");
```

```
#> [1] "EGADS! You have done this laboriously!"
```

Is 'malign' too _hoity-toity_ for you? Try some other commands (note: harshness
does not differ across commands):


```r
insult("${EXCLAMATION}! That was quite ${adjective}!");
```

```
#> [1] "SHOO! That was quite repellent!"
```

or:


```r
dis("${EXCLAMATION}!!! That was certainly a ${result}!");
```

```
#> [1] "TABARNAK!!! That was certainly a monumental failure!"
```

or:


```r
zing("${EXCLAMATION}! That code executed quite ${adverb_manner}!");
```

```
#> [1] "WTF! That code executed quite doubtfully!"
```

or:


```r
snark("${EXCLAMATION}! Your coding ability is just ${adjective}!");
```

```
#> [1] "PSHAW! Your coding ability is just withering!"
```

Note that capitalization in the inserted words will be the same as in the template:


```r
malign("${Exclamation}! ${EXCLAMATION}! ${Exclamation}! This is just ${adjective}!");
```

```
#> [1] "Blah! GAH! Christ! This is just obstinate!"
```

Currently supported parts of speech:


```r
names(malign_parts);
```

```
#> [1] "adjective"     "adverb"        "adverb_manner" "created"      
#> [5] "creating"      "exclamation"   "rpackage"      "frowny"       
#> [9] "result"
```
