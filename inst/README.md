Positive encouragement is nifty, but have ya tried _negative encouragement_?

## Overview
Everyone needs to be taken down a peg once in a while, especially oneself! Forked
from the complementary (_and_ complimentary!) package [praise](https://github.com/rladies/praise), malign provides
ready-made insults for use when code does not run as expected. Useful for
troubleshooting code, or just to make oneself feel bad.

## Installation


```r
devtools::install_github("josephwb/malign");
```

## Usage


```r
library(malign);
malign();
```

```
#> [1] "You are vain!"
```

`malign()` currently supports the following parts of speech:


```r
names(malign_parts);
```

```
#> [1] "adjective"     "adverb"        "adverb_manner" "created"      
#> [5] "creating"      "exclamation"   "rpackage"      "frowny"       
#> [9] "result"
```

You can pass a template specifying these supported parts of speech, and
`malign()` fills in random words of the matching type:


```r
malign("${EXCLAMATION}! You have done this ${adverb_manner}!");
```

```
#> [1] "WHOOP-DE-FUCKING-DOO! You have done this rashly!"
```

Prefer your jabs to be in emoticon form? No problem:


```r
malign("${frowny}");
```

```
#> [1] ">:("
```

Is 'malign' too _hoity-toity_ for you? Try some other commands (note: harshness
does not differ across commands):


```r
insult("${EXCLAMATION}! That was quite ${adjective}!");
```

```
#> [1] "OOH! That was quite obnoxious!"
```

or:


```r
dis("${EXCLAMATION}!!! That was certainly a ${result}!");
```

```
#> [1] "BOO!!! That was certainly a misfiring!"
```

or:


```r
zing("${EXCLAMATION}! That code executed quite ${adverb_manner}!");
```

```
#> [1] "EW! That code executed quite anxiously!"
```

or:


```r
snark("${EXCLAMATION}! Your coding ability is just ${adjective}!");
```

```
#> [1] "UGH! Your coding ability is just confused!"
```

Note that capitalization in the inserted words will be the same as in the template:


```r
malign("${Exclamation}! ${EXCLAMATION}! ${Exclamation}! This is just ${adjective}!");
```

```
#> [1] "Pfft! WOOPSIE! Bullshit! This is just bungling!"
```
